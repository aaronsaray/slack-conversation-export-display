# [WIP] Slack Conversation Export Display

This is the display mechanism for the [Slack Conversation Export](https://github.com/aaronsaray/slack-conversation-export) node app.

## Getting Started

Assuming you have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) installed and up and running, then do this:

`bundle install`

This will install anything needed to get this "site" ready.  

Then, make sure you put your export from your dated folder into the `_data` folder here.

Then,

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

This is a work in progress.  

## Todo

- [ ] Make individual conversation pages work (use collections? or something else?)
